# Project Title: GOOGLEtoCHATGPT

This repository contains two main projects: a Simple Search Engine and a Recommendation Engine. Both projects are designed as educational tools to illustrate the basics of search algorithms and recommendation systems in Python.

## Project Structure

1. `01. Building Simple Search Engine`
2. `02. Building Recommendation Engine`

### 01. Building Simple Search Engine

This section of the repository includes a Python-based simple search engine designed to understand the basics of indexing and search algorithms.

- `app.py`: The main Python script to run the search engine.
- `document_details.pkl`: A serialized file containing the details of the documents that are indexed.
- `index.pkl`: A serialized index file.
- `SearchApp.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook version of the search application.
- `SimpleSearchEngine.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook explaining the steps taken to build the search engine.
- `utility.py`: Utility functions used across the search engine scripts.
- `Blackboard.pdf`: A document explaining the theoretical concepts behind the implemented search engine.

### 02. Building Recommendation Engine

This part of the repository focuses on building a recommendation system using cosine similarity.

- `CosineSimilarity.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook illustrating the concept of cosine similarity and how it is applied in recommendation systems.
- `CosineSimilarity-1.ipynb`: A supplementary notebook to `CosineSimilarity.ipynb` with additional examples.
- `Recommendation Engine.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that walks through the creation of a recommendation engine.
- `imdb_top_1000.csv`: Dataset used for the recommendation system containing 1,000 top movies from IMDB.
- `utility.py`: Utility functions used across the recommendation engine scripts.
- `Cosine Blackboard.pdf`: A document explaining the mathematical concepts behind cosine similarity used in the recommendation system.

## Installation and Usage

To run the notebooks or scripts, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed, along with the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
